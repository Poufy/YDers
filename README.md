# TODO

- [x] Get the GET/POST/DELETE/UPDATE requests working on /api/teachers

- [x] Connect the api with the count of teachers to be displayed on the landing page dynamically depending on the database

- [ ] Submit the GET requests using the information from the dropdown menus

- [ ] SIGNUP/LOGIN in order to submit the form

- [ ] A seperate route for admins to be able to easily make post/delete/update requests

# Problems

Fetching the data:

Possible Solutions:

	- waiting for the data to be fetched entirely then loading the page and passing the data to the ejs file (slows down the website)

	- Learning and using Ajax to make fetch requests on the client side and update the DOM without having to reload the page (Good solution but needs learning Ajax)
